This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `GITHUB_USERNAMES`: A comma-separated string of GitHub usernames whose issues and pull requests will be fetched. (e.g., `user1,user2,user3`)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub Personal Access Token with `public_repo` and `read:user` scopes. This token is used to authenticate with the GitHub API and fetch data.

You can set these variables in a `.env.local` file for local development, or directly in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel) settings.
